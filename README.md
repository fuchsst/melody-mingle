# Melody Mingle

## Introduction

Welcome to Melody Mingle, an innovative music discovery game that brings people together through the universal language of music. This project is designed as a web-based application where users can participate in a unique social experience, sharing and discovering music in a fun and interactive way.

## About the Game

Melody Mingle is not just a game; it's a journey through soundscapes, personal stories, and cultural exploration. The game allows players to respond to music-themed prompts with song choices, creating a shared playlist in each session. As players contribute their selections, everyone gets a chance to listen, discuss, and learn about different musical tastes and the stories behind them. It's an adventure in music, emotions, and connections.

## Key Features

- **Group Play**: Designed for playing in groups, making it perfect for social gatherings, online meetups, or just for making new friends.
- **Music Prompts**: Each round features a thought-provoking prompt that encourages players to choose songs that hold special meaning, tell a story, or set a particular mood.
- **Discovery and Sharing**: A platform to discover new music and insights into your friends' musical tastes.
- **Non-Competitive Experience**: Focused on sharing and enjoyment rather than competition. There are no winners or losers, only explorers on a musical quest.
- **Integration with Music Services**: Seamlessly integrates with popular music streaming services for a vast selection of songs.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular with TypeScript, styled using Bootstrap for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Flask (Python), providing a robust and scalable server-side solution.
- **Database**: SQL with SQLAlchemy, managing game data efficiently and securely.
- **Deployment**: AWS, ensuring reliable and scalable hosting.

## Getting Started



## Project Structure

### Root Directory
- `README.md` - Project documentation.
- `.gitignore` - To specify untracked files to ignore.
- `frontend/` - Contains all Angular frontend code.
- `backend/` - Contains all Flask backend code.

### Frontend (Angular)
- `frontend/`
  - `src/` - Source files for the Angular application.
    - `app/` - Angular components, services, and models.
      - `components/` - UI components (e.g., header, footer).
      - `services/` - Angular services (e.g., API communication).
      - `models/` - TypeScript models or interfaces.
    - `assets/` - Static assets like images, fonts, etc.
    - `environments/` - Environment-specific configuration settings.
    - `index.html` - Root HTML file.
    - `main.ts` - Main entry point for the application.
    - `polyfills.ts` - Polyfills needed by Angular.
    - `styles.scss` - Global styles (using SCSS).
  - `angular.json` - Angular CLI configuration.
  - `package.json` - NPM package dependencies and scripts.
  - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration.
  - `webpack.config.js` - Webpack configuration (if custom configuration is needed).

### Backend (Flask)
- `backend/`
  - `app/` - Flask application.
    - `__init__.py` - Initializes the Flask application.
    - `routes.py` - Defines the routes/endpoints.
    - `models.py` - SQLAlchemy models.
  - `config.py` - Configuration settings for Flask.
  - `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies.
  - `run.py` - Entry point to start the Flask application.
  - `migrations/` - Database migration scripts (if using Flask-Migrate).

### Database
- For SQL and SQLAlchemy, database schema will be defined in `backend/app/models.py`.

### Deployment and CI/CD
- `.github/` - GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD (if using GitHub Actions).
- `Dockerfile` - (Optional) For containerizing the application.
- Deployment scripts or configuration files for AWS (e.g., `deploy.sh`, AWS CloudFormation templates).

### Additional Notes
- **Frontend**: Angular projects are typically initialized with Angular CLI, which will set up the basic structure.
- **Backend**: Flask allows flexibility in how you structure your project, but the above structure is a common pattern.
- **Bootstrap**: Integrated in the Angular project, usually via npm and imported into the styles.
- **Webpack**: Custom configurations can be added if needed, but Angular CLI's default build toolchain usually suffices.
- **SQLAlchemy**: Used in the Flask app for ORM.
- **AWS Deployment**: The specifics depend on the AWS services you choose (like EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, etc.).

This structure provides a clear separation of frontend and backend code, which is beneficial for development, maintenance, and scaling of your application.# melody-mingle
